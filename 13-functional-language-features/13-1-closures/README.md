# 13.1. Closures: Anonymous functions that can capture their environment

Closures:

- can be saved in a variable
- can be passed as arguments to functions
- can be created in one place, and then later called to evaluate it in a different context
- can capture values from the scope in which they're defined (unlike functions)
- allow for code reuse
- allow for behavior customisation
