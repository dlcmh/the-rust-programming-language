# 6. Enums and pattern matching

- enums is short for enumerations
- enums allow for a type to be defined by enumerating its possible variants
- Rust's enums are most similar to algebraic data types in functional languages such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell
- enum can encode meaning along with data
- the `Option` enum expresses a value that can be either something or nothing
- pattern matching with the `match` expression
- handle enums with the `if let` construct, another convenient and concise idiom
