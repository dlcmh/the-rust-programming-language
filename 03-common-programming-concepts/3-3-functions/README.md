# 3.3 Functions

Function names conventionally use _snake case_.

Parameters are special variables that are part of a function's signature. Each parameter must have a type.

The values that are passed to a function are known as "arguments".

Function bodies consist of a series of statements that optionally end in an expression.

Rust is an expression-based language:

- statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value
- expressions evaluate to a resulting value
